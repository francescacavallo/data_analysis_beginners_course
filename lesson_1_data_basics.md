# 📊 Data Basics for Absolute Beginners

Welcome! This guide introduces the core concepts of **data types** and **descriptive statistics** — foundational tools for anyone starting in data analytics.

## 🧠 What is Data?

Data is **information** collected for analysis. It can be **numbers, text, categories**, or anything measurable or observable.

---

## 🗂️ Types of Data

There are two main types of data:

### 1. **Quantitative (Numerical) Data**
Data that can be measured and expressed with numbers.

- **Continuous**: Can take any value within a range.
  - Example: Height, temperature, weight.
- **Discrete**: Can only take specific values.
  - Example: Number of children, cars in a parking lot.

### 2. **Qualitative (Categorical) Data**
Data that represents categories or labels.

- **Nominal**: Categories with **no inherent order**.
  - Example: Gender, color, country.
- **Ordinal**: Categories with a **meaningful order**, but not evenly spaced.
  - Example: Satisfaction level (Low, Medium, High), education level.

## 🧮 Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics help you **summarize and describe** the main features of a dataset.

### 🔢 Common Metrics:

| Metric           | Description                           | Example |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------|
| **Mean**         | Average value                         | Average income |
| **Median**       | Middle value in sorted data           | Median house price |
| **Mode**         | Most frequent value                   | Most common age |
| **Range**        | Difference between max and min        | Age range in a group |
| **Standard Deviation (std)** | Spread of values around the mean | How much variation in test scores |

## 📊 Example Table

| Person | Age | Education Level | Income ($) |
|--------|-----|------------------|------------|
| Alice  | 25  | Bachelor's       | 55,000     |
| Bob    | 30  | Master's         | 65,000     |
| Cara   | 28  | PhD              | 72,000     |

- Age → **Continuous**
- Education Level → **Ordinal**
- Income → **Continuous**
